Leafier: The Bukkit Server Web Panel! 

==What does Leafier do?==

The leafier panel is meant to be used by not only admins and mods, but the regular player as well! The system offers a fully-built, fully functional site for the server including: a Homepage, a Stats page, a Ban Appeals page, and Forums (Coming Soon!). Leafier aims to create a panel that is generally used by the entire community rather than the staff for administrating the server.
